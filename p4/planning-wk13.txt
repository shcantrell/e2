What routes will you have? (Include routes needed to handle form submissions).
From these routes, which controller/method(s) will be triggered?
What's the structure of your database table(s) (column names, data types)
What form input types will your game have, and how should those inputs be validate


PROJECT GOALS:
* Create a meal planner (total of caloric intake per day)
* Start with one day entry. 
* **IF** time permits:
    * Can a caloric goal be entered to offset the sum of indivdiual caloric entries made?
    * Is there an API that can auto input common food names and caloric count?
    * Can new intake fields be added? This will require new fields be added to the database.
    * If daily entry form is successful, expand to a weekly planner.
    * Can recipes be incorporated and broken down per servings? HA--unlikely!
    
INTERFACE/DATABASE REQUIREMENTS:
* Default enty ID (ID)
* Field for day of week
    * CHAR, max length = 5 for "THURS" as highest demominator
* Field for daily caloric goal (INT)
* Fields for food name and caloric intake
    * NOTE: After success with calculating "Meals," add "Snacks"
    * Meal 1 (VARCHAR)  Calories: (INT)
    * Snack 1 (VARCHAR) Calories: (INT)
    * Meal 2 (VARCHAR)  Calories: (INT)
    * Snack 2 (VARCHAR) Calories: (INT) 
    * Meal 3 (VARCHAR)  Calories: (INT)
    * Snack 3 (VARCHAR) Calories: (INT)
   
* Display sum of individual caloric intake will be needed (INT)
* Display how sum offests goal amount (INT)

ROUTES:
* Index page
* Calculations for caloric intake sum and how it offsets the goal amount
    * Sum of intput method
    * Difference of input with goal entered method
* Save input of entries made
    * Insert database method
* Display record of entries per date
    * Display per ID method
